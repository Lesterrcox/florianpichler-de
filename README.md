## Tools used

This page once started out as an excerise in minimalistic tooling. It was created just using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. That still works fine, even more so now. But mostly because I wanted to learn new stuff, this still rather small project now uses a few things to make my life easier.

* [Gulp][gulp]
* [SASS][sass], [PostCSS][postcss], [Autoprefixer][prefixer], [Critical][critical]
* [Rollup][rollup]
* [ESLint][lint], [Prettier][prettier]

## Inspiration

[Tim Van Damme][maxvoltar] inspired me back in 2012 to create a small personal website, linking to all my other profiles. Many others have similar pages, but his stuck in my head back when skeuomorphisms were still en vogue. I decided to keep it that way.
